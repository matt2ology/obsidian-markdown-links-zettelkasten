# Obsidian Zettelkasten Using Standard Markdown Links

Best for shared and public knowledge repository: this is my declarative workflow and structure of a Zettelkasten with Obsidian using [standard Markdown link formats for internal links](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Supported+formats+for+internal+links) and published works. I've tried to streamline the process of how to use the Zettelkasten system to enable one to be less of a content consumer, and become empowered to create content of their own via published works.
